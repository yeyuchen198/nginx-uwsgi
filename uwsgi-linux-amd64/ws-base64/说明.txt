go env -w GOARCH=amd64
go env -w GOOS=linux

go env -w GOARCH=arm64
go env -w GOOS=android


如果出现exec format error，说明GOARCH或者GOOS不匹配，
termux要设置：
go env -w GOARCH=arm64

再执行go run即可！

I had this problem - it was very simple: I had set $GOOS to something other than the OS I was testing on. You can't do cross-platform testing. So for "go test", don't set $GOOS. I'm pretty sure the "Exec format error" you got was a result of go test trying to execute something on the wrong architecture/OS.
